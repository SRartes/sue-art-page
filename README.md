# Sue's Art Page

Welcome to my personal art page!  
I'm Sue, a self-taught artist who enjoys creating with oil, acrylic, gouache, and pencils.  
This site is just a place for me to share the art I’ve made—no titles, no curation, just my creative journey.

Thank you for stopping by and taking a look!
